<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I have been playing guitar for over half of my life, and bass for nearly as long. I have lent my skills to a considerable number of bands in the Chicago area. In addition to my personal music endeavors, I participated in the music programs in both middle and high school. I was in choir for 7 years, which enabled me to travel to New York and perform at Carnegie Hall in an honor choir on two sepaerate occasions. I was part of the vocal jazz small group at my high school as a baritone/bass, as well as the all men's acapella group. I also participated in my school's jazz and pep bands as both a guitarist and bassist, and took home the Louis Armstrong Jazz Award for outstanding performance in my senior year of high school.</p>

<h2>Performing</h2>
<p>The vast majority of my participation in music comes from performing live. I started playing at a local coffee shop in my hometown when I was 12, and played there every weekend for 3 years up until 2020. I then started a band with some of my high school friends and we played local bars and festivals up through graduation, which is when I left. The band is still going strong today with new members. I spent the next couple years filling in for whoever needed me, house bands at open mics and jams, acoustic duos and trios, even Cadillac Grove, a 10 piece rock band that plays all over the area. Currently, I am the lead guitarist in a duo with the very talented Jack Wiemeler, we average about 1 gig per week. In addition to our duo shows, I am the bassist for our full band and we are working on our first album, all original hard rock and grunge.</p>

<h2>Other Music Projects</h2>
 <p>Besides performing live, I am working on several other music projects, some for school and some for fun. I am currently in the process of writing and creating original music to serve as the soundtrack for RetroShift Digital's final installment of Space Altercations in Space. I am also working on a parody of Mountain's "Theme to an Imaginary Western" for the end credits. Besides that, I have a <a href="https://justinwatt.bandcamp.com">Bandcamp page</a> for some of my school projects, including some drum loops, foley narratives, and a heavy interpolation of Beck's "Earthquake Weather". I also have some clips of my live playing and other random music things on my YouTube channel, which is linked below.</p>
