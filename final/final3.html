   <h2>RetroShift Digital</h2>
   <p>Back when I attended UNL, some close friends and I started <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@retroshiftdigital">RetroShift Digital</a>, our own little independent film and media company. I am the resident sound and music guy for the company. For our productions, I have done foley work, voice acting, sound synthesis, music supervision and composition, and some boom mic work when we needed it. Our primary team is only 4 people, so we all wear a lot of hats. In addition to sound work, I have acted in front of the camera, assisted in writing and worldbuilding, and operated on-set lighting.</p>

   <h3><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1FnSz2YFLX8">Something Strange: A Ghostbusters Fan Film</a></h3>
   <p>Something Strange is our love letter to the Ghostbusters franchise, and our first real production during our freshman year. We crowdfunded a little over $1500 to get it off the ground. Our director, Nathan Smiley, wrote the screenplay, supplied all the camera and lighting equipment, did all the visual effects and cinematography, and built & modified all the props. Our stop motion expert, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@krakenfilms4896">Mac O'Brien</a>, modeled and hand animated the ghost for the movie. Our lead actor, Drew Carlson, paid out of pocket for his flight suit and STILL let us slime him for the movie. He and I also worked together on most of the sound aspects in post production, which was almost the entire movie besides a couple of spoken lines. In addition to post produciton sound, I did lighting, an arrangement of Elmer Bernstein's "Ghostbusters Theme" for the end credits, and voiced the ghost. We debuted Something Strange at UNL's Golden Cans film festival and took home the people's choice and best actor awards, beating out several senior capstone projects. It has racked up nearly 20 thousand views on YouTube and has had 2 articles written about it from <a href="https://ghostbustersnews.com/2023/05/16/new-ghostbusters-fan-film-something-strange-is-now-streaming-online/">Ghostbusters News</a> and <a href="https://insidethemagic.net/2023/05/brand-new-ghostbusters-movie-is-already-available-to-watch-dr1mmb/

<h3>The Ape-Man of Lincoln</h3>
   <p>The Ape-Man of Lincoln is a humorous spoof of the old school detective noir movies. Think black and white, 4:3 ratio, trench coat and fedora type. It follows two detectives that apprehend a black market German peanut peddler and interrogate him to get to Lincoln's most wanted criminal mastermind, the Ape-Man. It was originally slated to be almost 40 minutes long, but because I left Nebraska and we only had a week to film everything, it was heavily revised so that we could get it done by the end of the semester. I play the role of the German peanut peddler, aptly named Peanuts Johnson, as well as the Ape-Man himself. We still plan to revisit this and create what we originally envisioned, especially because there was a freak storage drive accident that destroyed all of our archival footage. The only evidence of its existence is some behind the scenes photos, posters, and a rough cut of the movie. Nathan wrote, directed, edited, and played Chief Detective Hank Bingus. Drew played Detective John "Rookie" Rookman. Our new addition to the team, Taylor Bevans, helped with on-set lighting, camera work, and holding the boom mic along with Mac. Taylor has since become an integral part of the crew, helping with writing and directing and all sorts of things for our projects since Ape-Man. In addition to playing the villains, I also recorded/sourced all the foley and ADR for the movie, as well as supervised the soundtrack.</p>

<h3><a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6mLlFSz2SRZTdILhOpFe8LU1-ammdmed&si=3hkQzwuVot5hstXr">Space Altercations in Space Series (& its tie-ins)</a></h3>
   <p>Space Altercations was created as a LEGO stop-motion Star Wars spoof for a 48-hour film festival at UNL. As you may tell from watching it, we didn't take the writing seriously at all. Mac masterfully animated the entire short within the weekend, Nathan did his vfx magic and voiced our main character, John Spaceman, and I lent my voice to the character Cowboy Dan (God rest his soul). It performed so well at its initial debut that we won people's choice and best overall film for the festival. In turn, we made a Space Altercations for nearly every weekend-long film festival that followed. By the time the second one was made, I had already left UNL to transfer to Illinois State, but I still reprised my role as Cowboy Dan, and continued to help write and worldbuild for all the other installments. We are currently working on a Cowboy Dan origin story spinoff and, more importantly, The Final Altercation to wrap everything up, and we are merging all of our previous projects that were thought to have nothing to do with the SAiS universe. It is projected to be a full feature-length production, and the most heart wrenching story ever to be unfurled on the big screen.</p>

<h2>Visual & 3D Art</h2>
   <p>While it is not my strong suit, I still enjoy making digital art, particularly posters. I have one of my own works hanging on my bedroom wall, which I think is pretty cool. I dabble in 3D design and printing as well. As of right now I have a good understanding of AutoCAD, which is where I designed the 3D works you are seeing below, but am currently learning Blender since it applies more for what I like to do.</p>
