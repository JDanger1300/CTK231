INT. TEMPLE BUILDING - FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
Carlson dashes down the hallway with terror on his face. The
ghost soars quickly behind, screaming all the way. Towards
the end of the hallway, Carlson briefly spots the trap
laying on its side. He runs for it, quickly picks it up and
turns it on. A blinking red light turns on. He holds it by
the end of the cord and faces it out towards the incoming
spectre. The ghost gets closer. He SLAMS his foot on the
pedal.
Nothing.
He looks at the trap, then down at his foot. The cord is
disconnected from the pedal. He frantically kneels down to
reconnect the pedal. His nervous shake causes it to not go
in right away.
CLICK.
He plugs the cord into the pedal. Another red light blinks
on the pedal. He quickly stands back up with the trap.
SLAM!
The ghost flies right through Carlson, knocking him over and
caking him in slime! He hits a table, then a wall, and then
falls right onto his back. The ghost trap falls out of his
hands and lands upright on the floor.
IT REVS UP!!!

5.
The ghost hears the sound and turns around and looks back at
him. A look of relief suddenly overcomes Carlson. The ghost
screams angrily and flies towards him.
The end of the neutrona wand flares, and with a loud blast,
the bright, glowing beam of energy shoots out towards the
ghost.
The beam stops the ghost dead in it's tracks as the beams
ensnare it.
He looks around for the trap, and when he sees it kicks it
out underneath the captured ghost. He pulls the ghost closer
and hits the pedal again. The trap's doors open with a
mechanical whir, and a blinding cone of light emits out from
the box. Immediately, the ghost screams in agony as its
sucked into the cone of light. It pushes and pulls at the
beams wrapping around it to no avail. As its form distorts
further as its sucked in, it reaches its hands out in
towards Carlson one last time before being completely taken
within the trap. The cone of light dissipates and the doors
immediatley snap shut. A yellow LED bargraph fills up on the
front of the trap, as well as a blinking yellow light.
He sighs in relief. In the corner of the room lies the
broken P.K.E Meter. He walks over and picks it up and walks
away.
As he leaves, he walks past all the destruction left at his
feet.
EXT. TEMPLE BUILDING - MIDNIGHT
Carlson walks out of the building dripping with slime and a
proud look across on his. The ghost trap dangling from the
cord in his hand. Steam is seeping out of the thin gap of
the trap doors. A woman walks past him.

WOMAN

Gross.

He looks down disappointedly.
CARLSON

Aw.

EXT. TEMPLE BUILDING - MIDNIGHT
MOONLIGHT casts over the entire campus. On the south edge of
the campus the sidewalks are practically empty with the
exception of the occasional passerby. Opposed to its busy
day, in the night it is a ghost town. And speaking of ghost,
parked and running idly out on the curb is the ECTO ONE; an
old Cadillac retrofitted with lights, sirens, and any and
every tool a paranormal investigator may need. Behind, an
old brick and mortar building seemingly looms over it. A
sign out front reads: "JOHNNY CARSON SCHOOL OF THEATRE AND
FILM."
A beat.
Suddenly, a sound of a particle accelerator being revved up.
BURSTS of neon orange and blue light SURGE through a window
from the upper floors of the house.
INT. TEMPLE BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
The SURGES of blasting light continue.
The college is in complete disarray. Chairs and tables
toppled. Papers and books thrown about. On some walls and
doors a trace of ectoplasm. On the bulletin board there is a
tear-a-ticket flyer for a "PARANORMAL INVESTIGATION
INTERNSHIP PROGAM." The tagline reads "LET A TRAINEE TAKE
THE CALL AND GET TEN PERCENT OFF!" Only one ticket has been
torn off.
INT. TEMPLE BUILDING - ATTIC - CONTINUOUS
The attic is no different. Objects are strewn about the
entire room as if a tornado hit. On the floor is a puddle of
neon green slime with almost a metallic sheen. A pair of
combat boots step right through it.
Revealed is CARLSON in a khaki flight suit and PROTON PACK.
On his belt a P.K.E METER humming softly. The narrow path
illuminated by his vertical FLASHLIGHT clipped on his suit,
and the faint moonlight through the small skylights. He
stops as the P.K.E METER loses the signal, and he begins to
turn around in an attempt to keep it.
Behind him, a few books begin to quietly float across to
other shelves. CARLSON is none the wiser.
He begins to walk back the way he came as he traces the
signal. He turns the corner of the attic and stops dead in
his tracks. CHEWING GUM falls out of his now agape mouth. He
turns back around the corner to hide and compose himself. He
takes a deep breath and turns back to face the apparition.
He slowly grabs the GHOST TRAP from a holster on his hip and
roles it out so it's under the ghost. He grabs the neutrona
wand from his pack and fires it up. It REVS up. The ghost
looks at him when it hears the noise. Carlson fires the

2.
neutrona wand. He misses the ghost, who turns around and
flies away in terror. Carlson gathers the trap and runs
after it.
INT. TEMPLE BUILDING - SECOND FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
He checks the corner to see if he's clear, then slowly
reaches at his belt to reveal a CLIPBOARD. On it is a
checklist of indetifiers and characteristics to help
categorize the ghost. Carlson grabs a PEN and checks a box
on the list.
A ROAR. Something down the hall SHATTERS. CARLSON makes a
run for it.
INT. TEMPLE BUILDING - FIRST FLOOR - CONTINUOUS
He makes it down to the front doors of the college building,
but the locks on the door twist shut. He pulls as hard as he
can but fails to open the doors. He is trapped. Just then,
it goes silent. FOOTSTEPS can then be heard coming down the
stairs. His P.K.E Meter begins to whir. Carlson grabs his
wand and holds it in his hands with a white-knuckled grip.
The footsteps stop, and the door to the stairwell slowly
CREAKS open. Then the P.K.E Meter goes silent.
A beat.
The meter instantaneously goes from silent to off the charts

with activity. He REVS the pack up-
WHOOSH!
    <p class="textb"> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thenathansmiley" target="_blank">This is also a different link.</a> 
   Carlson is THROWN BACK by the ghost! He lands on his back
and slides down a hall.
SMACK! CLANG!
His gear goes flying and lands with a big THUD. His NEUTRONA
WAND powers down with an almost sad tone, and his pack
fizzles out. He frantically presses the trigger to no avail.
He looks at the meter now across the room as it still whirs
incesently, then at the GHOST TRAP thrown in the opposite
direction. He picks himself up and quickly runs out of the
room. The P.K.E meter goes haywire and a crack shoots down
the glass screen.
Carlson SPRINTS down the hallway as he desperately tries to
get his pack working. Behind him holes in the walls
spontaneously appear closer and closer to him, as if some
imperceivable being is hitting them while chasing him.
As he runs he spots a pair of doors labeled "WORKSHOP." He
runs in.

3.

INT. TEMPLE BUILDING - WORKSHOP - CONTINUOUS
Carlson runs in and immediately bee lines for a workbench.
In his hand he's reading from the "EQUIPMENT AND PROTOCOLS
MANUAL."

CARLSON
(Reading to himself)
...in the event of a collision, the
pack will release the cyclotron's
vacuum to halt the production of
protons...

In one motion he runs over while unbuckling his pack and
throwing it onto a table.
CARLSON
(cont'd)
...to reset the pack, first ensure
the Clippard pneumatic valve is
fastened onto the synchronous
generator with an air tight seal...

He opens the drawer and immediately begins searching. He
finds a WRENCH and runs back over to the pack.

CARLSON
(cont'd)
...then flip the lever underneath
the gear box to the "on" position.
The N-Filter will automatically
engage and evacuate the
cyclotron...

WHAM! He slips on another puddle of slime and SLAMS against
the table. His screwdriver skids across the table. He
quickly reaches to recover it and instantly begins to
tighten some bolts on the pack. He flips a switch on the
pack, which causes it to rev up with a different, more
mechanical noise. Streams of air hiss outwards from a small
cylinder at the bottom of the pack. He sighs in relief and
throws the pack on, and just in time too, as a thick fog
begins to roll in through the gaps in the door. Carlson
pulls out his neutrona wand once again and waits.
Far in the room, a chair is thrown upwards. Then another
one. Soon chairs closer to Carlson begin get thrown, until
finally...
ROAR!!!
The ghost flies out from behind a table and screams at
Carlson.

4.
BLASTS of unstable light and energy expel from the barrel of
the wand with a plethora of sparks and smoke, keeping the
ghost at bay. Carlson quickly reaches at the side of his
belt like before for his trap and quickly realizes it's not
there. His face deadpans.
CARLSON

Shit.

Then the pack begins to whine and fizzle out. The wand
sputters.

CARLSON

Shit!

The wand eventually dies off completely. The ghost screams
at him and flies towards him angrily.

CARLSON

SHIT! A beat.

Carlson runs out of the workshop.
