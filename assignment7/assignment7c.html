You'll get it straight again
Hey girl, you may as well blow the rent
Wanna have to lose yourself again

Bittersweet and starlit dreams
Come from blood red wine
Save yours, it seems
Come from another time
Come from another time

Hey girl, I thought we'd go and sit quietly
Have a drink and think about old times

Hey girl, you're trying to change a thing that's done
Tryin' for a magic that won't come

Bittersweet and starlit dreams
Come from blood red wine
Save yours, it seems
Come from another time
Come from another time

Bittersweet and starlit dreams
Come from blood red wine
Save yours, it seems
Come from another time
Come from another time

   You've got a bad reputation
That's the word out on the town
It gives a certain fascination
But it can only bring you down
You better turn yourself around
Turn yourself around
Turn it upside down
Turn yourself around
You had bad breaks, well, that's tough luck
You play too hard, too much rough stuff
You're too sly, so cold
That bad reputation has made you old
Turn yourself around
Turn yourself around
Turn it upside down
Turn yourself around
(Coolest guitar solo ever)

    ("Look, I know the supernatural is something that isn't supposed to happen, but it does happen.")
 Jesus lived His life in a cheap hotel
On the edge of Route 66, yeah
He lived a dark and twisted life and He
Came right back just to do it again
Eye for an eye and a tooth for the truth
I ain't never seen a demon warp dealin'
A ring-a-ding rhythm or jukebox racket
My mind can't clutch the feeling
Yeah!
Devilman, Devilman (calling)
Devilman (running in my head, yeah)
Devilman, Devilman (calling)
Devilman (running in my head, yeah)
Hell hounds lead at the cowardly kings
And carry souls across the river Styx, yeah
They see no evil and feel no pain
Sucking juice from a fallen angel
I dreamed I was a super nova fucker nitro
Burning and fuel injection
Feed the gods a strychnine soul
A motherfucker of invention
Yeah!
Devilman, Devilman (calling)
Devilman (running in my head, yeah)
Devilman, Devilman (calling)
Devilman (running in my head, yeah)
("Insipientia corde suo, non es deus
Non est vita qui adorem, non es usque ad unum
Es excommunicatus, ex unione fidelium.")
("It is not heresy. And I will not recant.")
Yeah, inbreed the witches and worship the dogs
Deformed and fuckin' lazy
Damn yourself and choke on my name
I'd love to love ya, baby
Deadringer rats swinging in the trees
Immaculate conception
Bury me an angel God
I need some inspiration
Yeah!
Devilman, Devilman (calling)
Devilman (running in my head, yeah)
Devilman, Devilman (calling)
Devilman (running in my head, yeah)
