  <h2 class="h2a">Welcome!</h2>

  <p class="texta"> Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur *fridge magnetica*. Deep in the algorithmic jungle,  
    a man named Derek declared himself CEO of Gloops™. “If it ain’t neon,” he said,  
    “it ain’t real.” Suntory and Jameson nodded from the corner, clinking glasses full of  
    existential dread and lemon-flavored LaCroix. Sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna tequila. Et tu, Rumpleminze? Rumor has it, Hemingway’s ghost still audits the bar tabs of men who think they can outdrink a metaphor. Every rule in the universe is written in crayon on the underside of a ceramic frog. The sun pretends not to notice. Someone hums an unfinished sentence. The air turns green with the smell of freshly folded questions. The field hums quietly beneath the second moon. Nobody planted it, yet the wheat grows in perfect cubes, humming elevator music from an alternate timeline. An old radio whispers something about soup. Every third cloud contains a memory you didn’t agree to keep. A beetle wearing a crown of lint proclaims himself Minister of Unseen Furniture. Somewhere, a door opens without walls. The Cha Cha Slide is the killswitch for independent thought. 3oz young gouda, 3oz gruyere, 2oz quality parmesean, 4oz sharp cheddar, 1/2 can evaporated milk, packet of gelatin powder, 1 tablespoon water. Emulsify over low heat with an immersion blender then refrigerate until solid. Has the texture and melting quality of American cheese but tastes like all those good cheeses. Killer for a grilled cheese sandwich. To a freak like the Ape-Man, banana bread is just regular bread.

  <p class="textb"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JDanger1300" target="_blank">This is a link.</a> The moon owes me rent money. DiGiorno is a mindset, not a meal. Rotating slabs of consciousness doing the worm on a pile of expired coupons, chanting “Modelo time!” like monks of the algorithm. Dr Pepper gospel on the radio, rerun dreams of a raccoon who sells enlightenment for forty-nine easy payments of $19.95. Blue Moon in the bloodstream, Beck in the Bluetooth, the toaster won’t stop posting motivational quotes in Comic Sans. Wet socks of destiny, sticky countertops of regret, Elon Musk somewhere eating crayons and calling it performance art. Veni vidi truly I drank. Tangerine bones. Mirror sandwich. A candle named Eric vibrates at 3 megahertz of nostalgia. There are no spoons, only the memory of soup doing sit-ups in an empty hallway. At this point you're probably wondering if I typed this out or had ChatGPT generate some word vomit. You'll be concerned with the ratio of what I typed vs what was ai generated. That grilled cheese thing is legit I swear it's so good. An unblinking moon shouts “Potato!” and all the shadows switch teams. If you drink a magic 8-ball it lets you see the future. My friend Kieth did it and said he was gonna die then he did. Our arrows will blot out the sun. Their blood shall run in rivers throught the streets. KFC will close permanently. Come on down to the Toilet Paper Emporium where we interview guys named Mort. This guitar is hand etched from a rich mahogany indigenous to the region. Cage free. Corn fed. Farm to table, table to farm, the circle of life continues. Twice baked. BEACHWOOD AGED, GENUINE COUNTRY MUSIC. FOR THE PEOPLE.

   Toaster screaming Morse code at the wallpaper again, the wallpaper blinks back in hexadecimal. A single bean of unknown origin rolls across the floor humming the national anthem of a country that doesn’t exist. Space War… Space War never changes…
It is Space Tuesday, and the tyranny of the galactic Dictator, Space Obama reigns throughout all of space. The brave alliance of freedom fighters known as the Beliebers are the only force that can challenge him.
Striking blows at Space Obama’s army from a million bajillion space miles away, the Beliebers have won their first victory in battle against the space ops, and it’s all thanks to the leadership of one unlikely hero, John Spaceman, and his now ex-girlfriend, Space Princess Diana.
“It’s not you, it’s me,” she had said to him, just moments before he was to fly into the core of the Obama-Dome and destroy the central energy core. Something the boys in space would’ve called “a total dick move.”
Amidst the chaos of the galaxy, two of the Rebel Alliance's most daring fighters, John Spaceman and Cowboy Dan, embark on a mission that could change the course of the war. Their target: the powerful Glorbo's Staff, a weapon that could give the rebels the edge they need to defeat the Empire once and for all.
Their mission takes them to the heart of the Empire's stronghold, where they encounter a formidable obstacle - Space Princess Diana and Space Obama, who have been tasked with guarding the staff.
Undeterred, John and Cowboy launch a daring assault, utilizing their cunning and skill to evade the Empire's defenses and infiltrate the facility where the staff is being held. However, they soon find themselves face to face with Space Princess Diana and Space Obama, who stand in their way.
But as the battle for the galaxy reaches its crescendo, an unexpected ally appears. Jesus Christ, the son of God, descends from the heavens to aid the rebels in their fight against the Empire.
A fierce battle ensues, with blaster bolts and lightsabers clashing as the two sides engage in a struggle for the fate of the galaxy. But as the battle reaches its climax, John and Cowboy manage to gain the upper hand, and succeed and are close to wrestling Glorbo's Staff from the grasp of the Obama’s soldiers. (That's a real title crawl from a real short film I was in)
 Blue chair melts politely into the wallpaper, whispering “clocks are just slow drums.” Seventeen bees in a trench coat audition for the role of geometry. Marshmallow gravity insists on back taxes from the floor. Oh No! It is the dive rocket launcher! Please take action regarding that individual. Relax I'll handle it, I am the angry pumpkin. BOOM! *silence*... The Architect and the Builder, they calmly arrive from their escalator with a sense of purpose. They are playing at their residence, the head is soaring. Three times did the cheese move sideways through Switzerland. Oh yeah? Well I crush the alien. Expert textpert choking smokers don't you think the joker laughs at you? ho ho ho, hee hee hee, ha ha ha. See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky see how they fly. I'm cryin'. In the time of Chimpanzees I was a Monkey, butane in my veins and I'm out to cut the junkie with the plastic eyeballs, spray-paint the vegetables dog food stalls with the beefcake pantyhose. Pretty nuts how those last few were actual song lyrics.
